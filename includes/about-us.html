				# What Is 100 Midnds?

				100 minds is a non profit organisation that brings together some of Irelands top undergraduate students and connects them with one cause to achieve big goals in a short space of time.

				By taking on over 100 of Irelands top undergraduates and challenging them to raise €1,000 each, we set ourselves the goal of collectively generating €100,000 in a lean and transparent way.

				By partnering with one organisation in need of large scale support, we work closely with stakeholders to identify how we can best use this money to achieve long term positive impact for society.

				This involves sitting down with key decision makers, identifying where the money is needed most and developing a detailed spend breakdown that aims to holistically improve and enhance the organisations operations to better the lives of the people they support and work with everyday.
